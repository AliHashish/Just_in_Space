# Just In Space Game

### Our Game Description
We developed a game where players create a ‘perfect’ organism that travels freely in space. The organism is characterized by imitating all other organisms’ strongest points to survive in space. The players can experience this arduous, yet exciting, journey from the organism’s point of view. The game would enable many people, especially the youth, to experience what hardships face humanity when sending people to space. It would also teach them about different organisms, and how they adapted to their environments. This would promote the youth’s growth, and might light some cinders of discovery in their brains, which could very well make them space pioneers one day.
